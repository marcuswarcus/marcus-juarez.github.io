<h1>The Starship Fleet</h1>
<h2>Oribtals</h2>
    <h3>O1</h3>
    <p>We reserve O1 for our very short orbit trips its has moderate luxury and being so featured for our very affordable missions (will add picturs showing off various areas of each shisp)</p>
    <h3>O2</h3>
    <p>This one is for a much longer missions mostly the week long ones as 7/14 and being one of our larger ships alot more people can fit on this version while still being affordable.</p>
<h2>Interplantary Ships</h2>
    <h3>Flight 1</h3>
    <p>This ship is used stritly for moon missions as it's supplies caches aren't as high as others so that it can conserve space designed for 1-2 week missions this layout features multiple anmenties so that our guest can enjoy their time on the ship.</p>
    <h3>Flight 2</h3>
    <p>This is our first long flight ship as it isnt too luxrious it does feature a gym such to keep your strength up so that the gravity change won't be so great of a change. This ship is relativley small though but it will be great for transporting people who are trying to travel to another planet on a budget and our scientist and such.</p>
    <h3>Flight 3</h3>
    <p>This being our luxrious option for our flights to Mars and Venus. The rooms in these are much nicer as well as the areas to go and viewing areas are much more vast. </p>
