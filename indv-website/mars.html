<h2>Itinerary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meet at our earth base station which is located in Los Angeles, California.</li>
    <li>We will lift off via our Space Shuttles designed to safely transport you to our orbital base station.</li>
    <li>You will Board your desginated ship and be shown to your room.</li>
        <li>As we take off from the station we will ask guest to stay in their rooms as we disengage from our orbital.</li>
    <li>Once the Captain has given the green light you will be able to move around the ship freely.</li>
        <li>This being one of our longer trips it will be a mininum of 2 years</li>
        <li>As this trip is more for scientist and serious space enthusiast the amenties on these ships won't be as glamorous but there will still be events and such on the ships during the flights</li>
        <li>Upon arriving at Mars you will attach to our Mars orbital and we will ther land on our Mars City.</li>
        <li>There you will have time to spend at our gravity defying <a href="marscity.html">Mars City. </a></li>
        <li>Since Mars is such a long trip your requirment to return to earth is actually optional (with proper paperwork) you may choose to become a citzen of our city and work on mars and help our community grow.</li>
        <li>Since we will have ships departing every 6 months when you are ready to go back or your contract is up you may leave then.</li>
