<h1>Take a Trip!</h1>
<h2>Operation Oribit</h2>
    <p> Operation Orbit is a 3 to 7 day quest in which you will orbit around earth. This mission will take off from our base station as all of our missions do. This short mission last 3-7 days and is a great more affordable option for those who want to go into space and feel the effects of zero gravity. This being one of our more luxurious ships as well this is a great option for everybody and getting comfortable with taking flights to outer space. This will feature a  vast viewing area as we orbit around the earth in that period landing back at our base station. </p>

<h2>Operation Moon Base</h2>
    <p> In this Mission you follow in the footsteps of Apollo 13 as we take a trip to the moon. These will take 7-14 days as we set out and take a 3 day trip to the moon and land on our moon base here you can jump around at our Fabulous resort…. I mean its ight for being on the moon. There we will stay for a day or so and then head back. Our resort is a big seller here as you can experience the moon walks done by those of Neil Armstrong and experience things like basketball, soccer and hockey with the moon gravity trying to hold you back it will be a brand-new way of playing things as well as a relaxing salon and others various locations. </p>

<h2>Operation Cloud City</h2>
    <p>This will be our first long trip as we head to our closest sister planet Venus. Since the air is toxic and temperatures reaching of 600 degrees Fahrenheit on surface we will be visiting our cloud city that we’ve set up here this trip will be more for those interested in specifically studying Venus and how we can maybe approach living on here someday but for now the cloud city will have to do as we channel our inner Star wars on the planet of Bespin. This trip will be a 7-month Trip as it is a three-month march both there and back. On our extended flights we offer our variety of shows with our deal though Netflix and also these ships will feature gyms and other things to keep you active so the effects of gravity won’t be so bad when you return. </p>

<h2>Operation Red Planet</h2>
    <p>This will probably our last trip as we embark for now. As this will be a Mars based mission this mission will last a total of 2 years(I know crazy like serving a mission to Mars) People for this mission will have to be mentally and physically prepared for these types of mission once there you will land at our Mars Base station and then be shuffled down onto our Mars base(a lot nicer than our Venus mission). Here you can actually get a job and become a Maritain(not in any way required but is an option for those wanting to just travel) The Mars base is cool featuring at this point a living population and a stay at our Resort as you get re-equated with gravity (will be struggle for a lot of people) </p>
